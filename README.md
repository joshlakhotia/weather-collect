# Weather Collect Capstone Project

## What is Weather Collect?

Weather Collect is a full stack weather application utilizing MySQL, Java, React, and the Spring Framework.<br>
It's goal is to help outdoor enthusiasts decide on an activity and a location for that activity by displaying <br>
multiple weather forcasts on a single page. Gone are the days of having to navigate to seperate pages to get the weather.<br>
These forcasts can be seperated into "Collections" displayed on the left side-bar. Click on a collection and a display of<br>
weather forcasts that the user has chosen will be shown on the screen. <br>
Ex. A user makes a "Rock Climbing Utah" collection that shows the individual forecasts for rock climbing spots within <br>
a two hour radius of their house in Salt Lake City.
